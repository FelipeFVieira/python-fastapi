# Studies and Projects with FastAPI  

This repository contains my studies and projects developed using **FastAPI**, a modern and efficient web framework for Python.  

The goal of this repository is to consolidate my learning, explore the framework's features, and build applications that exemplify best practices in API development.  

## What is FastAPI?  

FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. It is based on Python 3.7+ and stands out for its high performance, simplicity, and integration with modern tools like **Pydantic** for data validation and automatic documentation with **OpenAPI**.  

### Key Features of FastAPI:  
- Automatic data validation.  
- Interactive documentation generation (Swagger and ReDoc).  
- Native support for asynchronous operations.  
- Extensible, with support for middlewares and integrations.  

## Prerequisites  

To run the examples and projects, you will need:  
- **Python 3.9 or later**  
- **Pipenv or Pip** (Python package manager)  
- A text editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., VSCode or PyCharm)
